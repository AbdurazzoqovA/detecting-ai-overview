# Detecting-AI.com

**Detecting-AI.com** is an AI-powered platform that detects whether text is written by a human or generated by artificial intelligence. We also provide tools for plagiarism detection and fact-checking. Our mission is to help educational institutions, publishers, and organizations build trust and transparency in the age of AI.

This repository is created for demonstration and evaluation purposes for the President Tech Award (awards.gov.uz). It includes detailed information about the technology, use cases, and our model architecture, without exposing sensitive or private source code.

## 🤖 AI Model Architecture

We use multiple models depending on the task. Our main **AI detection engine** is based on a fine-tuned transformer model optimized for classification of synthetic vs human-written text.

### Core Architecture

- **Model Base**: `DeBERTa-v3-large` and `RoBERTa-large` (for earlier versions)
- **Task**: Binary classification (`AI` vs `Human`)
- **Tokenization**: Hugging Face Tokenizer (byte-level BPE)
- **Output Method**: Mean-pooled representation + linear classification head → probability score
- **Inference**: Optimized for short/medium-length texts (100–800 tokens)

### Training Data

- Balanced dataset of **human-written** and **AI-generated text**:
  - Human: Wikipedia, Reddit ELI5, scientific abstracts, news articles
  - AI: GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, and other LLMs
- Custom datasets sourced and curated with real-world examples, including:
  - Student assignments
  - Blog posts
  - Research summaries
- **Multilingual support** trained on non-English corpora (Portuguese, Spanish, French, etc.)

### Evaluation Metrics

- **F1 score**: 0.92 (on balanced benchmark)
- **False positives**: <1.8% on academic test sets
- **Latency**: <600ms per 400 words (server-side inference)

## 🔍 Additional Features

- **Plagiarism Checker**: Compares input against web and internal databases for similarity.
- **Fact Checker**: Uses retrieval-based QA and semantic matching to flag false or outdated claims.
- **API Access**: High-volume usage for universities, publishers, and LMS platforms.
- **Dashboard**: Allows users to manage checks, share results, and access history.

## 🧑‍💻 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Firebase Firestore
- **AI Serving**: PyTorch + Hugging Face Transformers
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Cloudflare CDN
- **Languages Supported**: English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Russian, Uzbek (coming)
